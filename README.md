Important notes

1. If you want to use your own dictionary, name the file wordlist.txt and place it inside the Hash_crackV2 directory.


2. ZCrack and RARNinja tools are better suited for older encryption implementations since they were developed some time ago. For decrypting modern compression formats, we recommend using Zip-Crack and Rar-Crack.


3. For DCC2 and WPA-PSK hashes, include the username or SSID along with the hash. For example:

WPA-PSK: MyNetwork:c5846b79d776cf7c0973edf6e8bb0778da330b1a92d18f6664557b1d9b7498dd  
DCC2: root:e7f9a1ba77b1d0406ab52783b2b9636a


4. In the script multi_hash_bruteforce.py, the user and SSID are requested after entering the hash.


5. Both the old and new implementations of DCC2 are supported.


6. For SHAKE-128 and SHAKE-256 hashes, it is mandatory to specify the hash type using the -t option. Auto-detection is not supported for these formats.


7. To perform brute-force attacks without a dictionary, use the script multi_hash_bruteforce.py.


8. To create custom password dictionaries, use the helper script crunch_manager.sh.


9. In Linux distros (Debian/Ubuntu) the installation of the Whirlpool module is done with 'sudo'

To avoid conflicts, but unlikely, you have the option to install Whirlpool from a virtual environment
